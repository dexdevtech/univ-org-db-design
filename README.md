# UNIVERSITY ORGANIZATION DATABASE DESIGN
I created this project as a gift to my former university organization. This will help them have a repository of all the data the organization had. Having a readily-available list of data of all students and professors can be very beneficial especially in information dissemination or getting in touch with organization alma mater.  Here are some of the projects benefits: 

<ul>
    <li> Holding Historical Record: The establishment of a database system is crucial for the organization as it enables them to maintain comprehensive historical records of their activities, achievements, and events. These records serve as a valuable resource for tracking their progress, preserving institutional memory, and ensuring transparency. Moreover, it is used to store the data of all the students and professors in the history of the organization.</li>
    <li> Reporting and Analysis: With structured data at their disposal, the organization can generate insightful reports and conduct in-depth data analysis. 
    </li>
    <li> Scalability: As the organization grows, a well-designed database system allows them to scale their data management effortlessly. It ensures that they can adapt to changing needs, accommodate a larger volume of data, and expand their operations without compromising data integrity or performance.
    </li>
</ul>

### Usage:

#### 1. Student and Professor Management

        Adding Students:

        INSERT INTO students (student_id, first_name, middle_name, last_name, email, date_enrolled, date_of_birth, gender, contact_number, barangay, city)
        VALUES ('2019-00001-ST-0', 'John', 'Michael', 'Doe', 'john.doe@email.com', '2022-08-15', '1995-03-20', 'Male', '09123456789', 'Barangay 1', 'City 1');

        Professor Management:

        Professors can be managed similarly with students.

#### 2. Classes Management
       
        Adding Classes:

        INSERT INTO classes (subject_id, professor_id, year_offered)
        VALUES (
            (SELECT subject_id FROM subjects WHERE subject_name = 'Introduction to Electronics'),
            'PROF1',
            '2023-01-01'
        );
        
#### 3. Officer and Award Management

        Assigning Officers:
       
        INSERT INTO officers (student_id, officer_type_id, year_of_service)
        VALUES
            ('2019-00001-ST-0', 1, '2023-01-01');
        
        **Recording Awards:**

        INSERT INTO top_performing_students (student_id, award_type_id, semester, year_received)
        VALUES
            ('2020-00009-ST-0', 1, 1, '2023-01-01');
        
#### 4. Data Reporting and Analysis
        
        Utilize SQL queries to generate various reports based on your data requirements. For example, to get a list of all awards won by the organization under a certain president.
        
        SELECT s.student_id,
                CONCAT(s.last_name, ', ', s.first_name) AS president,
                a.accomplishment,
                EXTRACT(YEAR FROM a.year_achieved) AS year_
                FROM officer_types ot
            JOIN officers o 
            ON o.officer_type_id = ot.officer_type_id
            JOIN students s
            ON s.student_id = o.student_id
            JOIN accomplishments a 
            ON EXTRACT(YEAR FROM a.year_achieved) = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM o.year_of_service)
        WHERE ot.officer_type = 'President'
            AND association_type = 'Organization'
            AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM a.year_achieved) = '2023';

#### 5. Scalability

        As your organization grows, you can continue to add data by executing `INSERT` queries and adapt SQL queries to handle increased data volumes. Ensure that your PostgreSQL database can handle the growth.


By following these usage instructions, you can effectively manage students, professors, courses, officers, awards, and perform data reporting and analysis directly within the PostgreSQL server.
